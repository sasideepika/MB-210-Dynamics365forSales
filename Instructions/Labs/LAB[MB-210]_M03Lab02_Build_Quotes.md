Module 3: Manage orders and product catalog with Dynamics 365
==============================

## Practice Lab 2 – Build quotes

Scenario
--------

As a sales analyst for the Dynamics 365 Sales implementation at World Wide
Importers, you need to test the newly configured product catalog enhancements to
the quoting process. In this lab, you will add product line items to an
opportunity and create a quote from that opportunity.

**Important Note:** This lab will provide you with an actual Dynamics 365 tenant and licenses for the Power Platform applications you will be using in this course. You will only be provided with one tenant for the practice labs in this course. The settings and actions you take within this tenant do not roll-back or reset, whereas the virtual machine you are provided with does reset each time you close the lab session. Please be aware that Dynamics 365 is evolving all the time. The instructions in this document may be different from what you experience in your actual Dynamics 365 tenant. It is also possible to experience a delay of several minutes before the virtual machine has network connectivity to begin the labs.
